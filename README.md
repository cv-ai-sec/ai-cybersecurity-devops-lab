# AI Cybersecurity DevOps Lab

A fully local, air-gapped, 100% open-source (MIT/Apache-2.0) DevOps + AI cybersecurity training
lab: a multi-agent Python backend coordinating Ansible, Docker, Loki/Promtail, and Trivy, fronted
by a local dashboard website — everything running against `127.0.0.1` only, on a local Qwen model
served by LM Studio.

Runs inside a VirtualBox Rocky Linux 9 VM, with LM Studio staying on the Windows host to use its
GPU directly — see [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for why and the full setup (WSL2 also works
if your Windows install doesn't have a broken servicing stack; this guide covers the VM path).

**[→ Live dashboard](https://cv-ai-sec.github.io/ai-cybersecurity-devops-lab/)** — a static build of
the dashboard below, viewable without running any of this yourself (see
[Publishing the dashboard](#publishing-the-dashboard-github-pages)).

## Mission

Build hands-on fluency in AI-assisted DevOps security workflows — deployment automation, log
telemetry, vulnerability scanning, and gated auto-remediation — using only local, open-weight
models and permissively-licensed tooling. No cloud API, no telemetry, no data ever leaves this
machine.

## Why this is safe to publish

- **Air-gapped by design:** all containers run on a Docker network with a fixed subnet, with
  internet egress blocked at the VM's host firewall (not Docker's `internal: true`, which turned
  out to be incompatible with published ports — see docs/SECURITY.md).
- **Loopback-scoped, not LAN-exposed:** services (Open-WebUI, Loki, the dashboard) bind to all
  interfaces *inside the VM* (VirtualBox's NAT can't reach a literal `127.0.0.1`-only bind — see
  docs/SECURITY.md), but the VM itself is only reachable from Windows' own `127.0.0.1` via explicit
  VirtualBox port-forward rules — nothing here is exposed to your LAN or the internet. LM Studio on
  the Windows host is reachable only from the VM's private host-only network — see
  docs/INSTALL.md step 9.
- **No real secrets required:** the local LM Studio server needs no real API key; `.env.example`
  ships placeholder values only, `.env` is git-ignored.
- **Pre-commit security checklist:** see [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) — followed before
  every commit, not just the first one.

## Architecture

## Getting started

Full step-by-step setup (installing Docker/Ansible/Trivy from scratch, configuring LM Studio,
bringing up the stack): [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

Quick version, once everything is installed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cd docker && docker compose up -d
cd ../agents && pip install -r requirements.txt
python telemetry_agent.py --sandbox-inspect   # Step 1: sandboxed log inspection
python counter_swarm.py                       # Step 3: simulated counter-swarm round
cd ../web && npm install && npm run dev   # http://127.0.0.1:4321
```

## Publishing the dashboard (GitHub Pages)

The dashboard (`web/`) is entirely static — both its Overview tab and its "Live Dashboard" tab run
on fixture data baked into the build (`web/src/lib/mockData.js`), not a live connection to your
Docker stack or agents. That means it can be published as a real, always-on page — the kind of link
you'd put in a LinkedIn profile — without anyone needing your VM, Docker, or LM Studio running.

Published automatically via **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`) — every push
to `main` that touches `web/` triggers a build (`npm install && npm run build`) and publishes the
result to GitHub Pages, no manual step required. Actions is free for public repos, and comfortably
within the free tier for private ones at this scale (this build takes ~1-2 minutes; the free tier is
2,000 minutes/month).

**One-time setup:** on GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**
(not "Deploy from a branch"). After that, just push — the workflow handles the rest, and the page
goes live at `https://cv-ai-sec.github.io/ai-cybersecurity-devops-lab/` within a minute or two of
each push. Check the **Actions** tab on the repo to watch a deploy in progress or see past runs.

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Guardrail |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | Runs Ansible against the local stack, summarizes results | Dry-run (`--check`) by default |
| Telemetry | Queries Loki, flags anomalies in recent logs | Untrusted log content wrapped in `<log_data>` containment tags; optional `--sandbox-inspect` runs raw-line inspection in the isolated sandbox |
| Vulnerability | Runs Trivy (offline DB) against images/filesystem, triages via LLM | Summary grounded strictly in scan JSON |
| Remediation | Proposes a fix command based on findings | Deterministic deny-list check + mandatory human approval before execution |
| Sandbox (`agents/sandbox.py`) | Isolated, disposable Docker boundary for running commands derived from untrusted log/scan data | `--network none`, read-only root, capabilities dropped, non-root user, bounded memory/pids/timeout |
| Counter-Swarm (`agents/counter_swarm.py`) | Simulated attacker traffic vs. a defensive swarm that "blocks" IPs and "rotates" mock tokens/keys | Fully synthetic — writes only to a local, git-ignored JSON state file, never touches a real firewall or credential |

These guardrails aren't decorative — they're the same lessons red-teamed and validated in the
companion [`Cybersecurity_AI_Learning`](https://github.com/cv-ai-sec/Cybersecurity_AI_Learning)
repo: schema/output validation isn't correctness validation, untrusted data needs structural
containment, and an LLM with tool access needs least-privilege scoping plus a human gate.

## Disclaimer

Educational lab running entirely on local infrastructure. No production systems, third-party
services, or real credentials are involved anywhere in this repository.
